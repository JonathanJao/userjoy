###### Definitions

Show the list of defined modules, actions and sent events for an app

###### Query engine

Primary Collections for segmentation:

- User
- Company
- Events

Types of queries:

- count
- hasdone
- hasnotdone
- attr


###### Apps

A account on Userjoy can have multiple apps.

###### Mandrill and Mailer

Every app has a default inbound email address which is "aid@mail.userjoy.co", where aid is primary key of the app on mongodb. e.g. "UserJoy <1234@mail.userjoy.co>", where aid = 1234

To create threads, we append the parent message id to the app email address, and create the reply-ro email. e.g. "Reply to UserJoy <1234+5678@mail.userjoy.co>" where aid = 1234 and message id = 5678. So, we know that the inbound message is a reply to message with id 5678

###### MetaData

We allow the apps to pass custom attributes related to users, companies and events. These attributes should be stored in a metadata field using (```metadata: [{ k: 'key', v: 'value'}]```) array. [Reference](http://calv.info/indexing-schemaless-documents-in-mongo/)

> #### Schema

> ##### Columns:
>
> - k (key)
> - v (value)
>
> ##### Notes:
>
> - Disabled creating an id for each subdocument
>


###### Query

- Run count query and attr query separately. This it to ensure 'AND/OR' work as expected across count and attr queries
- hasnotdone: query events by time
cases:
- Edge cases
1. sometimes hasdone event + hasnotdone event =/= total users



###### Email Types

- behavioral (segments, interval-hourly/daily, initially  just daily): for each segment, a user can get this message only once
- transactional (immediate): userjoy is not meant to send transactional messages
- newsletter (once, manual): will deal with this later. we already allow the user to send manual messages, just need to also allow him to customize the templates.

## Models


name          | embedded documents      | description
-----         | ----------------------  | -----------
Account       |                         | accounts on Userjoy
App           | team                    | apps belonging to an account
AutoMessage   |                         | automated messages
Company       |                         | companies of a specific account
Conversation  | Message                 | conversation threads between users and accounts
DailyReport   |                         | the score, usage of a user for a specific company (monthly)
Event         | meta (metadata)         | events belonging to a user
Invite        |                         | tokens of team members that have been invited to use an app
Notification  |                         | notifications to be shown to the user (only auto)
Segment       | filters                 | all the segments defined for an app
User          | companies               | users of a specific app. create a new user for every new unique identifier for an app
UserNote      |                         | notes created by team members about a specific user



### Account

##### Columns:

- email (required)
- name (required)
- password (required)
- verifyToken
- emailVerified (boolean)
- passwordResetToken
- ct
- ut

##### Notes:

- No need to store the reporting hour

### App

##### Columns:

- color (hex color code for notifications / feedback)
- ct
- isActive (boolean)
- name
- team [{accId, admin}]
- x tags [] stores all tags that the app has used for its users
- url (domain url)
- ut

##### Notes:

- Admin can add / remove access to team members. On adding / removing access both Accounts and Apps collections have to be updated. The Account should also be notified by email.
- Update 10-06-2014: Earlier, there were three additional keys (`live`, `liveKey`, `testKey`) to switch between live and test modes. Removed them because they were not helping in segregating data in a simple way across the User, Company and Event models. It would be preferable to have an array (embedded documents) of environments instead, and make all queries in the context of an `environment-id` rather than an `app-id`.

### User

##### Columns:

- aid
- user_id (to allow the app to recognize a user even if the user changes email/username)
- email (required)
- country (2 letter ISO-3166-1 country code, [REF](https://github.com/bluesmoon/node-geoip#looking-up-an-ip-address)
- x name
- x username
- x meta (object containing additonal info about users)
- unsubscribed (boolean)
- unsubscribedAt (date)
- unsubscribedThrough (messageId, subject)
- ct
- ut
- health (latest health status of the user, defaults to average for new user)
- joined (when did the user join the service)
- plan
- revenue
- score (latest engagement score of user, defaults to 50 for new user)
- status
- totalSessions
- lastContactedAt
- lastSeen (timestamp of last session of user)
- lastHeardAt
- ip
- x tags [] Stores tags for categorizing users
- companies [{cid, companyName, billing{}, healthScore, totalSessions}]

##### Notes:

- User can belong to multiple companies (In Userjoy's case, a user can belong to multiple apps)
  If so, we need to calculate the following attribute of a user on a per company basis:
    - healthScore
    - totalSessions
    - billing

- status must be one of [trial, free, paying, cancelled]
- Health score should be calculated based on total sessions in last 30 days, total time spent on site [?]

- Ignoring: user acquisition data like (since we do not have data for non loggedin users):
    - referredBy (document.referrer or $Direct)
    - search_keyword
    - utm_campaign
    - utm_content
    - utm_medium
    - utm_source
    - utm_term

- utm data could be added to sessions

##### Embedded Documents:


### UserNote

##### Columns:

- aid
- creator (accountId)
- ct
- note
- uid (user id)
- ut


### DailyReport

##### Columns:

- aid
- cid
- ct
- ds_{{date}} (score in the day, e.g. "du_23: 43")

- y (year: 2014-2100)
- m (month: 1-100)
- uid

##### Notes:

- We upsert the usage / score data on a monthly basis. Only one document per user-company per month.
Data is preallocated on first creation (from du_1 ... du_31, ds_1 ... ds_31). Usage / score default to 0
- Cron job should update a user's health score daily for each company that he belongs to
- Storing data in this manner will allow us to visualize the trend in an user's health over a period of time

### Company

##### Columns:

- aid
- company_id (required, similar to user_id)
- name (required)
- totalSessions
- x meta (object containing additonal info about users)

- x tags [] just like user tags

##### Notes:

- status must be one of [trial, free, paying, cancelled]
- ct property should not be automatically added on company creation



### Segment

##### Columns:

 - aid
 - creator (account id)
 - ct
 - filters (embedded documents)
