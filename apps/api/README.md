# API

This app contains an expressjs api which exposes a rest interface for the db.

## Notes

###### Query engine

The user event data will be exposed using [express-restify-mongoose](https://github.com/florianholzapfel/express-restify-mongoose) package

###### Visits

A 'Visit' can be defined as a 30-minute long session. Any event that occurs for a user within 30 minutes of his previous session will be added to the previous session.

###### Events & Visits

For the above, 'Events' can be embedded documents in the 'Session' collection **OR** the session document could have an array of object ids of all the events belonging to it

###### Apps

Allow multiple 'Apps' per account ?

### Features

Should be features be an embedded document inside Apps?

##### Columns:

- appId
- name

### Users

Stores users of a specific account

Create new user for every new unique identifier for an app

##### Notes:

- User can belong to multiple companies (In our case, a user can belong to multiple apps)
  If so, we need to calculate the following attribute of a user on a per company basis:
    - healthScore
    - totalSessions
    - billing

- The firstSessionAt attribute is added when a new user is created
- createdAt property needs to be provided to the js snippet
- Health score should be calculated based on total sessions in last 30 days, total time spent on site [?]

- Ignoring: user acquisition data like (since we do not have data for non loggedin users):
    - referredBy (document.referrer or $Direct)
    - search_keyword
    - utm_campaign
    - utm_content
    - utm_medium
    - utm_source
